This folder contains scripts that uses [heudiconv](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert DICOMs into [BIDS-format](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

- DICOMs are expected to be in "studyfolder"/dicomdir
- Heuristics-files are located in code-subfolder bids/heudiconv_heuristics
- NIfTIs are written into a BIDS-organised folder "studyfolder"/sourcedata (SIC!)

BIDS format: https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
